zak (Z80 Abstractions for Kernels)
==================================

What?
-----
A vaguely C-like language designed for low-level system programming on the
 Zilog Z80 processor.
A toolchain for use with this language (currently just a parser, but will
 eventually include a compiler).

Why?
----
Writing the kernel for pegboard (my SMP Z80 architecture, see
 <https://github.com/ec429/pegboard>) in assembly was proving just too much
 pain, and GCC doesn't have a (proper) Z80 backend.  Even if it did, it
 wouldn't really be suitable for my needs, because I want to be able to do
 crazy regparm things on a per-function basis (i.e. the function prototype can
 specify register linkage of some parameters) to make life easier for callees
 written in asm.
