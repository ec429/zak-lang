zak (Z80 Abstractions for Kernels)
==================================

What?
-----
A vaguely C-like language designed for low-level system programming on the
 Zilog Z80 processor.
A toolchain for use with this language, which compiles it to assembly language
 in the format accepted by GNU 'as' for the Z80.  (The compiler is implemented
 in Python.)
It's not finished yet; only a very restricted subset of the language makes it
 through all the stages without hitting any NotImplementedErrors.

Why?
----
Writing the kernel for pegboard (my SMP Z80 architecture, see
 <https://github.com/ec429/pegboard>) in assembly was proving just too much
 pain, and GCC doesn't have a (proper) Z80 backend.  Even if it did, it
 wouldn't really be suitable for my needs, because I want to be able to do
 crazy regparm things on a per-function basis (i.e. the function prototype can
 specify register linkage of some parameters) to make life easier for callees
 written in asm.
When (and if) it's done, it will hopefully be an ideal language for software
 which for other reasons is already not portable off Z80 machines, and which
 requires enough low-level hackery that the asm-friendly linkage (i.e. the
 "crazy regparm things") makes a useful substitute for inline asms.
Also, I wanted to learn compiler theory, and writing a compiler seemed like the
 obvious way to go about that ;)

How?
----
./driver.py [<infile>] [-o <outfile>] <options>
If <infile> is omitted, standard input is used.
If -o <outfile> is omitted, it defaults to 'a.out'.
Options:
-D enables debugging output (probably only useful for the compiler developer).
-n or --dry-run disables the writing of the output file, thus just checking
 whether the input can be compiled.  Again, probably mostly useful with -D.
-W[no-]foo enables [disables] warning foo.
-G[no-]foo enables [disables] generator option foo.
Warnings:
-Werror: treat all enabled warnings as errors.  Disabled by default.
-Wfunc-void: warn if a function is declared as taking a single argument of type
 'void'.  Usually this is because you thought you were writing C, and what you
 really wanted was a function taking no arguments.  Enabled by default.
Generator options:
-Gcheck-stack: start each function by checking that the caller provided the
 correct stack size in (IY-1); if not, call panic.  Disabled by default.

For implementation notes, see the file HACKING.

Who?
----
Developed by Edward Cree (ec429).
Compiler and example programs licensed under the GNU GPL version 2.  (To be
 absolutely clear: the compiler's license does _not_ infect the assembly
 output it generates, which is subject only to the licenses applying to the
 source files used as input.)
