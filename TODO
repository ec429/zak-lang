Next tasks that need doing
==========================

* Replace the ad-hoc parsing with something more formal, probably using
  funcparserlib.  Will also require teaching TACifier to consume the result.
* Implement struct member operations (. and ->)
* Arrays!  I've been putting these off because parsing, but they'll also lead
  to some work in the IR and codegen stages of course.
